## ðŸ’° Bank account Project 

## ðŸ”¨ Project objectives

- Create an initial header with the customer's data (Name, Account Type, and Balance).
- Create a menu that describes the operations. You can choose the method name that you prefer, such as withdraw (or transfer, sendPix) to simulate the withdrawal of funds from the account, and deposit (or receiveTransfer, receivePix) to represent the deposit of funds into the account.
e *deposita* (ou *recebeTransferencia*, *recebePix*) para representar a **entrada** de valores na conta.
- The menu should have four options: deposit, withdrawal, balance inquiry, and application exit.
- Remember that for withdrawals, sufficient balance is required.
- The menu should continuously appear until the user selects the option to exit.
- If the user enters any option that is incorrect, a message stating "invalid option" should be displayed.
- We will use the Scanner class to read the user's input.
